The idea of being able to run an autonomous organisation on a blockchain has been a dream until now.

## About me (us)
I have been working with EOSDAC since before the main EOS chain was launched in June 2018 but not quite as long as of the amazing founding members of the team. My background as a software engineer started in Melbourne, Australia before working with several major commercial and fin-tech organisations in London. I'm proud to have built out the most of the smart contracts that are now clustered together to operate the underlying, secure business logic components of eosDAC. Working with the team, as we have explored unchartered territory in decentralised governance and blockchain technology has been enormously rewarding and technically challenging in the best possible way.

## The journey so far
Our goal was to decentralise everything and remove ourselves as a central point of failure and control. As a software engineer, with experience in commercial, government and fin-tech organisations, these are bizarre goals to work towards but have also been simple and pure to keep in mind throughout our journey, since that's how organisations should be. I'm proud to say we have succeeded with this goal so far. We have been thoroughly testing everything as we go. We've been transparent with the process, shared our code on Github (warts and all), found and fixed bugs and continued to remove ourselves as a potential point of failure, and welcomed constructive criticism as a source of inspiration for continual improvement.

## Community support
I have been a strong advocate of blockchain, particularly EOS, and I'm sure I have bored many people explaining how amazing this technology is, and will be in the near future. In addition to helping the community through technical forums, I was a mentor at the 2018 EOS hackathon in London where I was able to meet and nurture the future creators in this amazing space. When I'm not writing smart contracts for eosDAC I have also been building out the iOS native app for the Karma dapp project, which I see as an opportunity to enable people from diverse socio-economic backgrounds to benefit from the decentralised cryptocurrency revolution. I will also continue to work and collaborate with important projects in the space as opportunities present themselves and find avenues to integrate for eosDAC.

## The Future
We have only just begun. eosDAC is a blueprint for what a DACs could be. The smart contract governance and technical design has not just been dictated by the immediate requirements for eosDAC but more about how others may use, adapt and leverage our open source code to operate as the governing framework for their organisation. With this in mind we have engineered the code for customisability for different organisations while not compromising on integrity or security.

I see eosDAC as a startup with big plans and my personal goal will be to help eosDAC, with the support of brilliant technical, managerial and legal minds, to achieve those goals through further smart contract development and evolution.
